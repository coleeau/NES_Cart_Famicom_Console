# NES Cartridge Famicom Console
An adapter to use NES cartridges on a Famicom

## Why
Primarily so i can use NES Games that are either NES exclusive (ie Tetris) or cheaper overall (ie accounting for shipping and import fees)

## Why not buy one
a few reasons here
- Harder to find than the adapter for the other way around
- ones you can find are too expensive, and are bare pcb
- all existing ones have the cartridge vertically. wobble will be bad for connection and it looks stupid
- many existing ones lack expansion audio and other issues

## Goal for adapter
- Horizontal orientation for adapter (think famicom network adapter meets Blinking Light Win)
- support for either no expansion audio OR expansion audio on EXP6 or EXP9
- support for cartridges that requite CIRAM /CE and PPU /A14 to be sepearate
